# Classification
In this project, the following classification methods have been implemented:
  - Naive Bayes Classification
  - Maximum Likelihood Classification
  - Maximum A Posteriori Classification
  - Minimum Education Distance Classification
  - Minimum Mahalanobis Distance Classification

Then classifiers are trained on 3 datasets and for each dataset their evaluation is implemented based on the confusion matrix.
